yourcontent - universal content liberation tool

This repo will be used to build a tool which gives users control over their own data, i.e. their contributions to sites like Amazon.com, Yelp, IMDB, Instagram, and many others. This would be accomplished through a simple architecture that scrapes information on the user's behalf (or uses an API where one is provided without unacceptable restrictions) and maintains a local copy.
