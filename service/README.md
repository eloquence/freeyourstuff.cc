This is a Node/Koa service. It's still pretty minimal, it currently implements:

- a landing page
- a signup/register flow with support for Twitter, Facebook, Google & local signup
- a very very rough API to stash data in MongoDB

Main TODOs right now:

- generalize schema handling
- clean up routes
- vet various security bits
- add library browse features, tech docs & mirror instructions
- deploy/build/logging fundamentals
