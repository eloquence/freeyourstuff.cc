This is a Node/Koa service for publishing datasets using the freeyourstuff.cc Chrome extension. It's still pretty minimal, it currently implements:

- a landing page and some additional page content
- a signup/register flow with support for Twitter, Facebook, Google & local signup
- a very rough API to stash data in MongoDB
- basic routes for viewing collections and showing most recently uploaded ones

Main TODOs right now:

- more security vetting
- add better library browse features
- deploy/build fundamentals
