Initial design notes:
- Probably will use Node + Koa + Passport (for auth)
- Publication will probably be geared towards web clients, therefore require
  presence of login cookie from freeyourstuff.cc
- Might want to support lightweight master/slave mode, to enable anyone to
  set up a mirror trivially
- No fancy search/navigation features planned right now, just raw dumps of
  the contents
