<p>
freeyourstuff.cc is an open source community project developed as a hobby.
Its purpose is to make it easy for anyone to access, export, and publish
their contributions to supported websites. It doesn't collect your data,
and it does't contain ads.
</p>
<h3>What the browser extension does</h3>
<p>
If you are logged in to a supported website like Quora or Goodreads, the
extension will navigate the website on your behalf to download your data. In
the process, it does <i>not</i> gain access to your user credentials, nor does
it "phone home" to this website about what it is doing.
</p>
<p>
Once a download process is complete, the extension will present your downloaded
data to you in a webpage generated by the extension. You can save a copy on your
computer from this page. The webpage generated by the extension does contact
<i>this</i> website to check if you're logged in.
</p>
If (and only if!) you choose to publish the data you downloaded under a free license, the extension
will upload it to this website. That's a completely optional step for users who
like free culture <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free-culture_movement">free culture</a>,
and want to release their work in a manner that allows others to build upon them.
<p>
<h3>What this website does</h3>
<p>This website really only does two things:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Inform users about the browser extension
  <li>Host a library of <a href="https://freeyourstuff.cc/browse">datasets</a>
      published using the extension.
</ul>
<p>
We keep normal server logs for up to 90 days (including your IP address), but we
don't run analytics software, tracking code, or ads. We set cookies when you
log in, and the Facebook/Google/Twitter login options require contacting those
third parties when you log in.
